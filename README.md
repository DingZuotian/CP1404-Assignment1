# CP1404-Assignment1
Q1:How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

It usually takes about 12 to 16 hours to complete this assignment project. This period of time covers the entire process from understanding the requirements, designing the program structure to implementing each function. Specifically, it includes building the basic framework, handling file reading and writing, implementing the user menu interface, developing book display and addition functions, as well as completing core modules such as input validation and error handling. In actual development, the time spent on debugging and testing is often more than expected, especially when it comes to ensuring that the output format exactly matches the examples and handling various boundary cases. The Settings for version control and code submission will also take up some time. Although some technical challenges may be encountered during the process, through systematic and gradual development, a complete program that meets all requirements can eventually be built, which lays a good foundation for more complex tasks in the future.

Q2:What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

Based on what I learned from Assignment 1, here's what I'd do differently for Assignment 2:I'd start by really understanding the new requirements with dictionaries, classes and GUI upfront, since these are bigger changes. I'd sketch out the class designs on paper first before coding anything.For the GUI part, I'd build it incrementally - maybe get a basic window working first, then add one component at a time instead of trying to make everything perfect in one go. I'd also create better test data early on, especially since we're moving from CSV files to more complex data structures. Having good test data makes debugging so much easier.Since Assignment 2 builds on this one, I'd refactor the working parts from Assignment 1 more carefully instead of rewriting from scratch. The book loading and saving logic would stay similar, just adapted for the new data structures.I'd pay more attention to separating concerns - making sure GUI code, business logic, and data handling are in different places. This became more important with the added complexity.And I'd commit even more frequently with better messages, especially when switching between adding new features and refactoring old ones.Basically, more planning upfront and smaller, more focused development steps would save time overall.
